This will mainly do fishing in the game stardew vally, 
Will do some more stuff in later versions
It works by taking screenshots of your screen and then determining if you have a fish or not

Note:
None of the images that are taken by this script are sent anywhere, they all stay on your local machine




Ingame settings that are needed:
-Turn screen mode to windowed
-Disable Pause When Game Window Is Inactive
