Use this script at your own risk

This will mainly do fishing in the game stardew vally
Will do some more stuff in later versions
It works by taking screenshots of your screen and then determining if you have a fish or not
The Design is very human


This script is also only ment for windows computers


Note: As of V1.0 the script can't do the fishing minigame well, so best to use a barbed hook


Ingame settings that are needed(Script won't work unless these are met):
-Turn screen mode to windowed
-Disable Pause When Game Window Is Inactive


Features:
-As of V1.0 can only auto fish during the day when skys are clear

More to come:
-Able to fish in the dark and in more areas
-More auto farming things



If it is unable to fish, try moving to another area

Please notify me of any issues
