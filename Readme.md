This will mainly do fishing in the game stardew vally,
Will do some more stuff in later versions
It works by taking screenshots of your screen and then determining if you have a fish or not

Note:
None of the images that are taken by this script are sent anywhere, they all stay on your local machine

This script is also only ment for windows computers


Ingame settings that are needed(Script won't work unless these are met):
-Turn screen mode to windowed
-Disable Pause When Game Window Is Inactive


Features:
-As of V1.0 can only auto fish during the day

More to come:
Stops fishing when energy is low
Able to fish in the dark
More auto farming things



Please notify me of any issues
